When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
penguins <- read.csv("penguins.csv")
summary(penguins)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
hist(penguins$bill_length_mm)
ggplot (data = penguins ) +
 geom_bar(mapping = aes( sex ), color = "black" ) +
 scale_fill_gradient(low ="red", high ="yellow")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
